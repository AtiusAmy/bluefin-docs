# Bluefin Docs

These docs are pretty sparse on purpose as Bluefin's intended to be invisible. Ideally the docs should be able to be consumed in one sitting.  

## Guidelines 

- Docs linking to upstream documentation directly with a short summary is preferred.
- There's likely a reason why something is undocumented.
