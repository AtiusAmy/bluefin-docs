# AI and Machine Learning

GPU Acceleration for both Nvidia and AMD are included out of the box and usually do not require any extra setup. 

### Desktop integration

[Install alpaca](https://flathub.org/apps/com.jeffser.Alpaca) to use a native desktop application. If you prefer an all-GUI solution just use Alpaca and manage your models from within the application. Alpaca supports Nvidia and AMD acceleration natively and _includes ollama_.

### Ollama CLI

If you prefer a CLI or to interact with the ollama server from your scripts, then you can install ollama with either 

- `brew install ollama` (recommended) with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ollama)
- The installation script from the [ollama website](https://ollama.com), but will require some manual tweaks in their docs to get it in your path.
