# Developer Mode (`bluefin-dx`)

The Bluefin Developer Experience (`bluefin-dx`) is a dedicated developer image with bundled tools. Unlike traditional Linux systems, the operating system and developer environment are explicitly and purposely separated. This means that tooling is not installed on the host, and is instead containerized, in a virtual machine, or scoped to the user's home directory. It is designed to meet the following use cases:

- Endeavors to be the world's most powerful [cloud native developer environment](https://landscape.cncf.io/)
- Full virtualization support

# The Cloud Native Development Approach

Bluefin goes "all in" on cloud native development and is used differently than a traditional distribution such as Ubuntu:

- Development is done in [devcontainers](https://containers.dev/)
- Command line applications are installed using [homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- Preconfigured ad-hoc containers for Ubuntu, Fedora, Wolfi, and a custom `bluefin-cli` container. Use whichever distribution you want. 

> This differs from apt, snap, and dnf where one packaging system handles both the graphical applications AND the command line applications.  This decoupling is what provides greater system reliability, near unlimited choice of software, and "distributed by default" development.  

In short, we picked it because this pattern is how servers are deployed in modern infrastructure. And the developers deploying those systems are already using homebrew and we want to leverage as much of that success as possible for the Linux desktop.

The pattern in `bluefin-dx` (and `aurora-dx`) are centered around container focused development using [devcontainers](https://containers.dev).  Since development is not dependent on the operating system image, you can use whatever you want, you do not need to use everything in here in order to be productive -- think of them as prepaved paths that you can choose to use.  

Dev Containers were chosen to facilitate distributed development, each project has a declarative environment that is intended to be start the user with a "best practice" cloud-native workflow out of the box. The [Ultimate Guide to Dev Containers](https://www.daytona.io/dotfiles/ultimate-guide-to-dev-containers) has a good write up of the advantages of using devcontainers.

Homebrew can also be used for installation of development tools. 

>**Note**: This is an opinionated developer workflow that [differs from Fedora's use of toolbox](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/toolbox/).  Toolbox is included for people who prefer the upstream approach. 

# Enabling Developer Mode

You can rebase to the dx image by using the following command:

## Step 1: Turn it on
`ujust devmode` to enable or disable the dx mode, then reboot:

## Step 2: Add yourself to the right groups 
`ujust dx-group` - to add your user account to the right groups. Then log out and back in. This step only needs to be done once. 

Like all Universal Blue images, switching is atomic, allowing for clean switching between modes depending on the use case.

# Features

## Command Line Experience

### Pet Containers

Long running processes should be kept in a pet container. Manage these via the included [BoxBuddy](https://github.com/Dvlv/BoxBuddyRS) application, available via the logomenu in the top left corner of your desktop under "Containers": 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdab71b0-c04a-4562-a73d-396d4b907060)

Use BoxBuddy's interface to create your own pet containers from whichever distribution is on the list:

For CLI warriors you can manage your containers with Ptyxis's built in container support: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a4dc4b5-f1a8-4781-80a4-92ea4dfeeb97)

[Ptyxis](https://universal-blue.discourse.group/docs?topic=300) also includes a host terminal so that you can quickly switch between containers and the host. 

- Further instructions on using Ptyxis: https://universal-blue.discourse.group/docs?topic=300
- [Podman Desktop](https://flathub.org/apps/io.podman_desktop.PodmanDesktop) - Containers and Kubernetes for application developers
- [Pods](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.marhkb.Pods) is also a great way to manage your containers graphically.

### Ephemeral Containers

Designed for quick usage and "I need a test terminal now!" use cases, Preconfigured **ephemeral** terminal workspaces are available with keyboard shortcuts:

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>u</kbd> - Launch an Ubuntu container.
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>f</kbd> - Launch a Fedora container.
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Alt</kbd>-<kbd>Enter</kbd> - Launch a [bluefin-cli container](https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/the-bluefin-cli-container/704) (Experimental).

Note: The initial setup will take some time depending on network connectivity. These containers are managed via a Podman Quadlet and **will be destroyed and updated regularly**.

# Other Tooling

## JetBrains

`ujust jetbrains-toolbox` will fetch and install the [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app) application, which will manage the installation of the JetBrains set of tools. This application will handle installation, removal, and upgrade of the JetBrains products, and is handled completely in your home directory, independent of the operating system image.

- Check the [Jetbrains documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/podman.html) for integrating those tools with the podman runtime. 
- Check out how to [setup Jetbrains with devcontainers](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/connect-to-devcontainer.html)
- [Uninstallation instructions](https://toolbox-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001313270-How-to-uninstall-Toolbox-App-)
